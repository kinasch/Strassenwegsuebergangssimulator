# Straßenwegsübergangssimulator
**Warning:** This is a cheap Frogger clone. Player discretion is advised.


## Idea and Name
The name is a german compound noun and means something along the lines of
"Roadway Crossing Simulator", but it's a word no one would ever use in this
particular phrasing as it sounds unnatural.

The idea was to create a game where you cross the street with a story
containing as much long german words as possible.

As I was too lazy to create a real game, I just thought I would keep my mind
sharp by doing my own version of Frogger. According to github, I created
this over the span of 8 days, mostly in August of 2021. The actual amount of
hours that went into this project were probably not even 20.

## Controls
Any Standard Movement Inputs (e.g. Arrow or WASD Keys) should move the frog.
ESC triggers the Pause, where the music can be muted.

# Sources
Everything, including the music, was done by me in
[Unity.](https://unity.com/)
## Music
I created the music using the [online sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net) made by
[Jacob Morgan](https://twitter.com/Jacob__) and
[George Burdell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Burdell).
